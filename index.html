                            There are no pain receptors in the brain itself. But the meninges (coverings around the brain), periosteum (coverings on the bones), and the scalp all have pain receptors. Surgery can be done on the brain and technically the brain does not feel that pain. With that said, the brain is the tool we use to detect pain.

                            Hello wasn't used as a greeting until many years later when the telephone was invented. Inventor Thomas Edison is given credit for suggesting the use of hello as a standard greeting when answering a telephone. Edison's competitor, Alexander Graham Bell, had his own idea for a proper telephone greeting.

                            New Zealand was the last country in the world to be discovered and settled by humankind. The last habitable landmass of any size to remain unpeopled. It is the last country on earth to have been inhabited permanently by humans.
